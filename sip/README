GIT Strategy in use for this project:

http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/


To use this plugin in dev mode, 

Add the following to your grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy

// Local plugins to include
// Include any local domain model plugins first
// grails.plugin.location.'iep-datamodel'='../iep-datamodel-plugin/iep-datamodel'

grails.plugin.location.'SIPlugin'='../../SemanticInformationManager/SIPPlugin'


-- A SIP project needs authenticated users. we normally use the nimble plugin for this:
grails install-plugin nimble 0.4-SNAPSHOT
grails jack-be-nimble <package> <User Class Name> <Profile Class Name>

so for us, thats mostlt

grails jack-be-nimble com.k_int.sim User Profile

You should also secure any URLs using SIM, initially, the dashboard URL is protected with 

        secure(controller: "home") {
            before = {
                accessControl {
                    true
                }
            }
        }

in you grails-app/conf/NimbleSecurityFilters.groovy

Finally for nimble, don't forget to add

plugins.mail=0.9

to application.properties

-- SIP has some defaut URL Mappings to get an app running as quickly as possible from only a domain model
To use them you may need to commment out all the default UrlMappings in your assembly project.
Specifically, SIP has a default mapping of / to it's dashboard controller.
